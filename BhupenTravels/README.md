#  Milestone Project - Bhupen Travel Agency  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## UX
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a designer of this website , i can say this website is different from others travel agencies.
The travellers can find top six destination places in India with google map and history of the 
places.

I want to give the travellers with good experience for the first visit itself.The website
also included packages for the visiting places with the main places to visit.

## User Stories
* as a user of the website, I can easily navigate between the sections of the website.

* as a first time user of the website, I can easily know what iam looking for in the website.

* as a first time user of the website, I can quickly get a sense of what the business is about
  and what they offer.

* as a potential customer, I can easily locate the business' social media profiles where I
 will be able to get more information and read reviews.

* as a returning customer, I can quickly get in touch with the business to discuss my next vacation
 without necessarily having to go through the other sections.

* as a potential customer who is trying to pick a destination, I can find information on the
 individual cities and compare my options.

## Wireframes

I draw the images how the webiste looks like so any one who wants to see ,its easy for them

## Technologies Used

* Javascript - This was used to add the google map functionality, the modal section and
 the contact form functionality.
* HTML - I used this to build the entire site and each individual page.
* CSS - This was used to style the html code.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) Bootstrap was used to make the site responsive on all devices and add the youtube videos and 
   the main structure of the site.
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) This was used with bootstrap to allow you to place certain elements and functionality on your page.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) This allowed me to upload my local repository onto a remote server for access for anybody.
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) I used this as my ide. The local repository along with all my code was stored here.
* [Google Maps](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/maps/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=FY18-Q2-global-demandgen-paidsearchonnetworkhouseads-cs-maps_contactsal_saf&utm_content=text-ad-none-none-DEV_c-CRE_267331561090-ADGP_Hybrid+%7C+AW+SEM+%7C+BKWS+~+EXA_+M:1_EMEAOt_EN_API_SQR-KWID_43700024190182920-kwd-295562633747-userloc_1012345&utm_term=KW_google%20map%20api-ST_google+map+api&gclid=Cj0KCQiApaXxBRDNARIsAGFdaB_Hb0dRUBRljLuse8LrG4XiN38_JgRvScdprtDZZGFhIDwat7-pw8UaAmXXEALw_wcB) JavaScript API was used to render the maps
   
 ## Testing

  The HTML code was put through the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check for syntax errors. Similarly, the CSS code was put
   through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

   All the following testing has been carried out on smaller screens running both iOS and Android 
   and on larger screens running both macOS and Windows in multiple browsers. In addition, 
   Chrome's developer tools were used extensively to test on all screen sizes including medium 
   size which I did not otherwise have access to.

   I also given close attention to the following scetions:

   * Navigation bar
   * images
   * Modals
   * Maps
   * Images
   
  Tested to open the pages on all sizes available in Chrome, Firefox, but not Edge, as it
   only had Slider available.

* 60 x 640 Galaxy S5
* 375 x 667 iPhone 6/7/8
* 375 x 812 iPhone X
* 411 x 731 Pixel 2
* 411 x 823 Pixel 2 XL
* 414 x 736 iPhone 6/7/8 Plus
